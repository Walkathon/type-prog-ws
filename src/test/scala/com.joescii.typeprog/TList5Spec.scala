  // See if you can parameterize TypeList with the contained type, so we can contain either Nat or Bool.

  // Some hints:
  //   1. Comment-out reduce because it won't make sense any longer.
  //   2. :: will now be ugly because it has 3 parameters and TNil is awkward with a parameter. Consider creating
  //      specialized types like :+: for Nat's :: and NTNil for instance in a companion object.
